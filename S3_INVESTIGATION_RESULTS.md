# S3 Public Access Investigation Results

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: ✅ S3 Configuration is CORRECT - Issue lies elsewhere

---

## Summary

After extensive investigation, **S3 is configured correctly** and files ARE publicly accessible. The "Unable to retrieve audio metadata" error from Sync.so is **NOT caused by S3 access issues**.

---

## Investigation Results

### ✅ S3 Configuration Verified

1. **Block Public Access**: All settings are OFF (confirmed by user screenshots)
2. **Object Ownership**: Set to "BucketOwnerPreferred" (allows ACLs)
3. **Public ACL**: Files have public-read ACL set correctly
4. **Public URL Access**: All files return HTTP 200 OK

### ✅ File Accessibility Tests

**Yesterday's successful files** (worked with Sync.so):
```bash
curl -I https://taylorswiftnyu.s3.amazonaws.com/users/.../audio-1760933985394-ptxxsvktf.mp3
# Result: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✅
```

**Today's failed files** (Sync.so error):
```bash
curl -I https://taylorswiftnyu.s3.amazonaws.com/users/.../audio-1760975550811-bf95zxvvg.mp3
# Result: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✅
```

Both return 200 OK! Files are publicly accessible.

### ✅ File Metadata Comparison

| Metric | Yesterday (Working) | Today (Failed) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| File Size | 200,037 bytes | 200,037 bytes |
| Content-Type | binary/octet-stream | binary/octet-stream |
| Public Read ACL | ✅ True | ✅ True |
| HTTP Status | 200 OK | 200 OK |

**Conclusion**: Files are identical and both are publicly accessible.

## Root Cause Analysis

Since S3 access is working perfectly, the issue must be with **how the request is being sent to Sync.so API**.

### Possible Causes

1. **API Request Format**: The JSON payload structure might be incorrect
2. **URL Encoding**: URLs might need special encoding
3. **Sync.so API Changes**: Their validation may have become stricter
4. **Content-Type Header**: Audio files might need proper Content-Type (not binary/octet-stream)
5. **Request Timing**: Sync.so might be checking file availability too quickly after upload

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Enable Full Request Logging ✅ DONE

I've updated `backend/services/sync_segments_service.py` to log the full JSON payload sent to Sync.so:

```python
logger.info(f"Sync.so API payload: {json.dumps(payload, indent=2)}")
```

### 2. Test Submission Needed

Please submit one more Pro Video Editor job with:
- 2 segments
- 2 audio files
- 1 annotation area (optional)

This will help us see the exact request being sent to Sync.so.

### 3. Compare with Working Payload

Once we see the failed request, we can compare it with yesterday's working requests to identify any differences.

## What We've Eliminated

❌ NOT S3 Block Public Access (confirmed OFF)
❌ NOT S3 Object Ownership (confirmed allows ACLs)
❌ NOT public URL accessibility (files return 200 OK)
❌ NOT file corruption (files are identical to working files)
❌ NOT ACL permissions (both have public-read)

✅ **Confirmed**: S3 configuration is perfect!

---

## Technical Details

### S3 Configuration Check Results

```python
# Object Ownership
Object Ownership: BucketOwnerPreferred  ✅

# File ACL Check
Public Read ACL: True  ✅

# HTTP Accessibility
curl -I https://taylorswiftnyu.s3.amazonaws.com/[FILE_PATH]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  ✅
```

### File Upload Code (Already Correct)

```python
# backend/services/s3/service.py:84
self.s3_client.upload_file(
    local_file_path,
    self.bucket_name,
    s3_key,
    ExtraArgs={'ACL': 'public-read'}  # ✅ Correct
)
```

---

## Conclusion

The S3 bucket is configured correctly and files are publicly accessible. The "Unable to retrieve audio metadata" error from Sync.so API is **NOT related to S3 access permissions**.

The issue is most likely in the API request format or how Sync.so validates the audio URLs. We need to see the full request payload to diagnose further.

**Action Required**: Please submit one more test job so we can capture the full API request in the logs.
