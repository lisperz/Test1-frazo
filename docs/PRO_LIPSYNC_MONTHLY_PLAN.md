# Pro Video Editor - Lip-Sync Feature Implementation Plan
## 5-Week Development Roadmap

**Duration**: 5 weeks (25 working days)
**Objective**: Implement Pro Video Editor with segment-based lip-sync capability
**Starting Point**: Basic Video Editor (text removal only)
**Target**: Production-ready Pro feature with multi-segment lip-sync

---

## Week 1: Requirements & Frontend Foundation

**Main Tasks:**

- Requirements analysis and technical design documentation
- Design TypeScript interfaces for segments and audio inputs
- Set up development environment and testing tools
- Create folder structure for Pro components

**Deliverables:**
- Complete technical specification
- TypeScript interfaces defined (segments.ts)
- Development environment configured

---

## Week 2: Pro Editor UI & Segment Dialog

**Main Tasks:**
- Create Pro Video Editor main component (copy Basic editor layout)
- Implement segment creation dialog with form validation
- Add time range inputs and audio file upload functionality
- Build segment list display (SegmentManager component)
- Implement segment CRUD operations in store

**Deliverables:**
- Pro editor UI matching Basic editor layout
- Segment dialog with validation (no overlaps, valid ranges)
- Segment list with edit/delete buttons
- "Add Segment" button in timeline controls

---

## Week 3: Timeline Visualization & Synchronization

**Main Tasks:**
- Integrate segments into existing Effect Track timeline
- Synchronize segment visualization with video playback
- Add segment labels showing time ranges on timeline
- Handle timeline zoom levels and segment positioning
- Frontend testing and UI polish

**Deliverables:**
- Segments displayed as amber bars in Effect Track
- Timeline synchronized with segment data
- Visual feedback for segment boundaries and durations
- Responsive design and error handling

---

## Week 4: Backend API & Database Integration

**Main Tasks:**

- Implement `/api/v1/sync/pro-sync-process` endpoint
- Build multi-audio file upload service for S3
- Add subscription tier validation (Pro/Enterprise access control)
- Integrate Sync.so API with segments array support

**Deliverables:**

- Pro sync API endpoint accepting video + multiple audio files
- S3 service returning refId → URL mapping
- Subscription tier enforcement middleware
- Sync.so API client with segment requests

---

## Week 5: Integration, Testing & Deployment

**Main Tasks:**
- Connect frontend submit button to backend API endpoint
- Build FormData submission with video + audio files + segments JSON
- Add WebSocket real-time progress updates
- End-to-end testing (segment creation, upload, processing, download)
- Production deployment and documentation

**Deliverables:**
- Complete workflow: upload → segment → process → download
- Job monitoring with real-time updates
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Production deployment with monitoring setup
- User documentation

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Each segment accepts separate audio file for targeted lip-sync
- ✅ Segment overlap validation prevents conflicts
- ✅ Timeline visualization shows all segments clearly
- ✅ Backend processes segments via Sync.so API successfully

---

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Material-UI, Zustand, ReactPlayer
**Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL
**External**: Sync.so API (lip-sync), AWS S3 (storage)

---

**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Estimated Completion**: 5 weeks from start date
